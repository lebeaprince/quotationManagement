# Registration and Login System with Spring-Thymeleaf, Spring-Security and, Spring-Validation

## Motivation and Introduction :-
For my previous Student Maanagement system, I had implemented backend db crud operations using Springboot and frontend part using Spring thymeleaf. So an improvement from my previous projects is to add Spring security . This improvement resulted a new project in which a simple user friendly Registration and login System was built using Spring thymeleaf for the front end where users signup and login . And these fields in forms are validated using Spring Validation, password is encrypted before storing into db and db has authentication based on user role using Spring security.
